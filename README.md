# **Morley** – Ladder Logic for Cardano Smart Contracts

**Morley** is a domain-specific language (DSL) that brings **Ladder Logic programming** to **Cardano Smart Contracts**, enabling automation engineers, industrial programmers, and IoT developers to build **blockchain-powered automation** with ease. 

By compiling Ladder Logic into **Plutus Core**, **Morley** simplifies smart contract development for those familiar with **PLC programming**, **embedded systems**, and **industrial automation**.

## **Why Morley?**
- 🏭 **Industry-Friendly** – Designed for engineers in **IoT, manufacturing, and automation**.
- 🚀 **Faster Development** – Write Cardano smart contracts in an intuitive Ladder Logic syntax.
- 🔗 **Blockchain Integration** – Secure, verifiable transactions on Cardano.
- 🔍 **Transparency & Auditability** – Track machine states, events, and industrial processes.
- ⚡ **Efficient & Lightweight** – Optimized for **on-chain execution**.

## **Use Cases**
**Morley** enables **trustless** and **automated** decision making in industries such as:
- **🏭 Industrial Automation** – Log sensor data, trigger smart actions on the blockchain.
- **📦 Supply Chain & Logistics** – Track inventory and automate contractual agreements.
- **🔋 Energy Management** – Secure monitoring of power grids and resource allocation.
- **🚀 Aerospace & Automotive** – Machine error tracking, predictive maintenance, and quality assurance.
- **🔗 IoT & Embedded Systems** – Secure communication between connected devices.
- **🏦 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** – Machine driven DeFi actions (e.g., automatic staking or lending).

## **Project Components**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **LadderCore** | Intermediate representation (IR) for Ladder Logic |
| **LL-Parser** | Parses Ladder Logic into IR |
| **PlutusLadder Compiler (PLC)** | Compiles IR into Plutus Core |
| **PlutusLadderSim (PLS)** | Simulates Ladder Logic in a blockchain environment |

## **Getting Started**
### 1️⃣ **Installation**
(Instructions for installing dependencies will go here)

### 2️⃣ **Example Smart Contract**
A **Ladder Logic-based Smart Contract** that tracks an **inventory system** on **Cardano**:

```ladder
(* Define Inputs and Outputs *)
X1   --[ ]----------------( )-- Counter1 (* Item scanned in inventory *)
X2   --[ ]----------------( )-- Counter2 (* Item removed from inventory *)

(* Trigger a blockchain event when threshold is reached *)
Counter1 == 100  --[ ]--( )-- TX_Send(* Mint new tokens when inventory is full *)
Counter2 == 0    --[ ]--( )-- TX_Send(* Burn tokens when inventory is empty *)

(* Implement a reset condition *)
Reset --[ ]--( )-- Counter1 (* Reset inventory counter *)
Reset --[ ]--( )-- Counter2 (* Reset removed items counter *)

### 3️⃣ **Compile to Plutus Core**

```bash
morley compile contract.ll

## 🎨 morley GUI
