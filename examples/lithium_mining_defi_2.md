# Tokenized Lithium Production with On-Chain Contracts and Hydra

## 1. How This Works: A Two Tier Blockchain Architecture

### On-Chain (Main Cardano Layer)
- The initial Plutus contract is deployed, defining rules for minting and burning LIT tokens.
- It holds the master state of all LIT tokens.
- It allows final settlement of token movements after off-chain Hydra interactions.

### Off-Chain (Hydra Layer for Machines)
- Machines ping the contract via Hydra to see if they qualify for minting/burning.
- Transactions occur at high speed, off-chain, but follow the on-chain contract rules.
- Final state is committed to Cardano when necessary.

## 2. Deploying the Initial On-Chain Contract

```haskell
{-# INLINABLE validate #-}
validate :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ScriptContext -> Bool
validate datum redeemer ctx =
    let txInfo = scriptContextTxInfo ctx
        action = findDatum "ACTION" redeemer
        oreFeed = findDatum "ORE_FEED" datum
        reactorTemp = findDatum "REACTOR_TEMP" datum
        purity = findDatum "PURITY" datum
    in
    if action == "MINT" then
        traceIfFalse "Ore feed below threshold" (oreFeed >= 500) &&
        traceIfFalse "Reactor temperature out of range" (reactorTemp >= 700 && reactorTemp <= 720) &&
        traceIfFalse "Purity below required level" (purity >= 99.5)
    else if action == "BURN" then
        traceIfFalse "Burn request invalid" (oreFeed == 0 && reactorTemp == 0 && purity == 0)
    else
        False

script :: PlutusScript
script = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| validate ||])
```

## 3. Machines Ping the Contract on Hydra

### Machine Queries Contract via Hydra

```json
{
  "query": "MINT_ELIGIBILITY",
  "inputs": {
    "ORE_FEED": 520,
    "REACTOR_TEMP": 710,
    "PURITY": 99.7
  }
}
```

### Hydra Contract Response

```json
{
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "message": "Eligible to mint 1000 LIT tokens"
}
```

## 4. Machines Execute Mint/Burn Transactions

### Machine Submits Mint Request

```json
{
  "action": "MINT",
  "inputs": {
    "ORE_FEED": 520,
    "REACTOR_TEMP": 710,
    "PURITY": 99.7
  }
}
```

### Hydra Response

```json
{
  "status": "MINT_SUCCESS",
  "message": "1000 LIT tokens minted"
}
```

### Machine Submits Burn Request

```json
{
  "action": "BURN",
  "inputs": {
    "ORE_FEED": 0,
    "REACTOR_TEMP": 0,
    "PURITY": 0
  }
}
```

### Hydra Response

```json
{
  "status": "BURN_SUCCESS",
  "message": "500 LIT tokens burned"
}
```

## 5. Periodic State Commitments to Cardano

Hydra does not require every transaction to be settled on Cardano. Instead, machines operate off-chain, and final balances are settled periodically.

### Final On-Chain Settlement

```json
{
  "blockchain_settlement": {
    "epoch": 432,
    "final_mint": 10000,
    "final_burn": 5000,
    "net_change": "+5000 LIT tokens"
  }
}
```

## 6. How This Enables DeFi

- LIT tokens are staked in lending pools, allowing miners to take loans against future lithium production.
- Battery manufacturers must burn LIT tokens when lithium is consumed in battery production.
- The token supply is fully auditable through on-chain records, preventing over minting.
- Traders can speculate on lithium demand by trading LIT tokens on Cardano DEXs.

## 7. Full System Flow

1. The Plutus smart contract is deployed on Cardano defining mint/burn rules.
2. Machines ping the contract via Hydra to check if they qualify for minting.
3. Machines submit transactions to Hydra, avoiding main chain fees.
4. Hydra processes mint/burn actions, handling thousands of interactions instantly.
5. Periodic settlements commit final balances to the Cardano main chain.
6. LIT tokens integrate with DeFi, supporting lending, trading, and supply chain verification.

## 8. Why This Model Works

| Feature | Benefit |
|------------|------------|
| **Main Chain Contract** | Immutable mint/burn logic ensures trust. |
| **Hydra Off-Chain Processing** | High speed machine interactions with near zero cost. |
| **Periodic Settlement** | Ensures Cardano maintains an accurate, verifiable record. |
| **DeFi Utility** | LIT tokens power lending, staking, and supply chains. |
| **Real-World Asset Integration** | Tracks lithium supply from mining to manufacturing. |

## Conclusion

By deploying the initial contract on Cardano and handling machine interactions off-chain via Hydra, this system achieves:

- Real time machine validation without main chain congestion.
- Tamper proof supply chain tracking for lithium production.
- A dynamic token model that integrates with DeFi.
